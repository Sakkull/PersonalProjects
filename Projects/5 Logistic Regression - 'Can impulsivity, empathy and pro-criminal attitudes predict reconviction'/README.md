# Investigating the relationship between attachment styles and self-alienation
&nbsp;
#### **INTRODUCTION**
From various risk assessments it is known that sexual offenders have 'criminogenic' needs in the areas of empathy, emotional regulation and sexual pre-occupation. These are becoming more and more targeted by new interventions and are useful to some. However, at the same time, there are many who are reconvicted and it has been argued that there are some variables that might be able to predict how likely one is to be reconvicted. Therefore, this current study is interested in whether impulsivity, empathy and pro-criminal attitudes can predict reconviction while controlling for the effect of gender.

#### **DESIGN**
Data was obtained from 335 participants who completed 3 scales: Impulsivity scale, Empathy scale and Pro-criminal attitude scale. For the three scales, higher scores indicate higher levels of the concept (i.e. high impulsivity,high empathy, and high level of pro-criminal attitudes). After they were released from prison a follow-up was done looking at whether they were reconvicted or not.

#### **RESULTS**
A logistic regression was conducted to examine whether impulsivity, empathy and pro-criminal attitudes can predict reconviction (whether ‘reconvicted’ or not), while controlling for gender. The control variable of gender was entered in block 1. The model was not significantly better than a constant –only model: χ2 (1) = .04, p > 0.05. The addition of impulsivity did lead to an improvement in the model: χ2 (1) = 4.58, p = .032, however this still did not lead to a significant model: χ2 (2) = 4.63, p = .098. However, the addition of empathy did lead to a significantly better model: χ2 (3) = 10.14, p = 0.017. This model also produced good model fit as assessed by the Hosmer and Lemeshow test: χ2 (8) = 11.72, p > 0.05. Also, the model explained between 3 % (Cox and Snell) and 4% (Nagelkerke) of the variance with 66.6% of cases correctly predicted. 
The addition of pro-criminal attitudes improved the model: χ2 (4) = 30.60, p < 0.01; and produced good model fit as assessed by the Hosmer and Lemeshow test: χ2 (8) = 12.87, p > 0.05. The model explained between 8.7% and 12.1% of the variance, with 68.1% of cases correctly predicted. 
In the final model, the addition of the interaction between impulsivity, empathy and pro-criminal attitudes, however, did not improve the model: χ2 (1) = 0.99, p = 0.31.

#### **Conclusion**
The 3 variables: impulsivity, empathy and pro-criminal attitudes provide a good model for predicting reconviction rates while taking into account gender. It was found out that with these variables in mind, up to 68.1% of cases were correctly predicted.
